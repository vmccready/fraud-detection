It allows users to define page content using vocabulary that can be easily recognized by Google\u2019s search function and incorporated into Google search results. Microdata can be used to designate an official URL, a bio pic, and product images, and to distinguish these from other page content. And because Microdata is a less-hyped feature of HTML5, your competitors may not have added it.<\/font><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"georgia, palatino\" size=\"2\">This course will provide students with a working understanding of Microdata.
