  What is scores?
  Scores is the dictionary that was created by the function in
  application.py which that also called this html file.
  That dictionary is then available for us to iterate through.
  What is item?
  Item is a row of values for a datapoint.
  
  Each table data <td> is assigned the index of each of those values.
  The output display is a table that looks like a data frame that our
  dictionary represent.
-->
  So for each item in the scores, remember, scores is the name of the dictionary that was the output of a function in the app -->
